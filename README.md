`cproc` is a [C11] compiler using [QBE] as a backend. It is released
under the [ISC] license.

Some [C23 features] and [GNU C extensions] are also implemented.

There is still much to do, but it currently implements most of the
language and is capable of [building software] including itself, mcpp,
gcc 4.7, binutils, and more.

It was inspired by several other small C compilers including [8cc],
[c], [lacc], and [scc].

## Requirements

The compiler itself is written in standard C99 and can be built with
any conforming C99 compiler.

The POSIX driver depends on POSIX.1-2008 interfaces, and the `Makefile`
requires a POSIX-compatible make(1).

At runtime, you will need QBE, an assembler, and a linker for the
target system. Since the preprocessor is not yet implemented, an
external one is currently required as well.

## Supported targets

All architectures supported by QBE should work (currently x86\_64 and
aarch64).

The following targets are tested by the continuous build and known to
bootstrap and pass all tests:

- `x86_64-linux-musl`
- `x86_64-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-freebsd`
- `aarch64-linux-musl`
- `aarch64-linux-gnu`

## Building

Run `./configure` to create a `config.h` and `config.mk` appropriate for
your system. If your system is not supported by the configure script,
you can create these files manually. `config.h` should define several
string arrays (`static char *[]`):

- **`startfiles`**: Objects to pass to the linker at the beginning of
  the link command.
- **`endfiles`**: Objects to pass to the linker at the end of the link
  command (including libc).
- **`preprocesscmd`**: The preprocessor command, and any necessary flags
  for the target system.
- **`codegencmd`**: The QBE command, and possibly explicit target flags.
- **`assemblecmd`**: The assembler command.
- **`linkcmd`**: The linker command.

You may also want to customize your environment or `config.mk` with the
appropriate `CC`, `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.

Once this is done, you can build with

	make

### Bootstrap

The `Makefile` includes several other targets that can be used for
bootstrapping. These targets require the ability to run the tools
specified in `config.h`.

- **`stage2`**: Build the compiler with the initial (`stage1`) output.
- **`stage3`**: Build the compiler with the `stage2` output.
- **`bootstrap`**: Build the `stage2` and `stage3` compilers, and verify
  that they are byte-wise identical.

## What's missing

- Digraph sequences ([6.4.6p3], will not be implemented).
- Variable-length arrays ([#1]).
- `volatile`-qualified types ([#7]).
- `_Thread_local` storage-class specifier ([#5]).
- `long double` type ([#3]).
- Inline assembly ([#5]).
- Preprocessor ([#6]).
- Generation of position independent code (i.e. shared libraries,
  modules, PIEs).
